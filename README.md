# SVG Preloader

*Date: 2016-05-18*

The logo is typed in text in Adobe Illustrator and converted to curves. The rest of the animation was written in code.

For best performance, animation steps are synchronized with browser rendering.

The image is adapted to different screen resolutions and the logo ratios vary depending on the device. The logo looks larger on mobile than on desktop.

All animation logic is implemented inside the SVG file. This makes it easy to use this preloader in other projects.
